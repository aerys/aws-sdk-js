**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Is the issue in the browser/Node.js?**
Browser/Node.js

**If on Node.js, are you running this on AWS Lambda?**
AWS Lambda uses older version of SDK as documented in their [runtimes documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). You can include latest version of SDK by following [these guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-create-deployment-pkg.html#nodejs-package-dependencies)

**Details of the browser/Node.js version**
Paste output of `npx envinfo --browsers` or `node -v`

**SDK version number**
Example: v2.466.0
* For browsers, the SDK version number is in the script tag <pre>src=".../aws-sdk-<b>2.466.0</b>.min.js"</pre>
* For Node.js, get SDK version by
  * running command `npm list aws-sdk` from your root directory
  * printing the output of `AWS.VERSION` in your code where `AWS = require("aws-sdk");`
